Description
How to use

“samplesCollection.py”
Essentially a way to run “get_samples.py” multiple times and receive data on it. The script sets a delay and window width for the staircase. It then pokes for a system reset, and a channel reset. It then begins to readout and print the number of resets per channel. After it has done so for the requested number of runs, it will print out arrays of each reset value requested, alongside the average and standard deviation per channel.

“trigReadTen.py”
	Literally runs “trig_and_read_FIFO_all_ch.py” 10 times. It contains a for loop that runs this script 10 times. 
	python3 trigReadTen.py

“runMagicSequence.py”
	A script that runs each python script involved in the magic sequence, sequentially. In order it runs, “set_Thresholds.py TP 2 .800”, “set_Thresholds.py VCOMP 1 .780”, “set_Thresholds.py VCOMP 2 .950”, “Serial_Interface-fix.py 1 0x55B680CE”, “Integrator_rst_fix.py 1”, “Calibrate.py”, “Serial_Interface-fix.py 1 0x55B6FFC6”, and finally “Serial_Interface-fix.py 2 0x55B6FFC6”. 
 	python3 runMagicSequence.py


“currentSweep.py”
	A script that runs get_samples for each replenCur bit from 31-8. It runs as many times as requested and returns averages and standard deviations. It uses the script “samplesCollection.py” and the curReplen bits are set to default (010).
	python3 currentSweep.py {# of runs}
   

“currentSweep0.py”
	A script that runs get_samples for each replenCur bit from 31-8. It runs as many times as requested and returns averages and standard deviations. It uses the script “samplesCollection.py” and the curReplen bits are set to the highest setting (000).
	python3 currentSweep0.py {# of runs}
